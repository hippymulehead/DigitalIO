#MBed style DigitalIO for Arduino.

Currently DigitalOut is written and working.  It uses direct port manipulation under the hood but only deals with PORTD & PORTB so it works on Uno and Nano styled boards.

Useage:

To define a new DigitalOut  
    DigitalOut led1(13,0); // That's pin to do the DigitalIO on and the initial value.  No more setup is needed.

To set the pin high  
    led1 = HIGH;

To set the pin low  
    led1 = LOW;

To invert the pin  
    led1 = !led1;

Per request you can also use led1.state to get the state of the pin.

---

You can also do a direct write without using the internal state by doing the following
    led1.write(HIGH);

```
#include <Arduino.h>   
#include <DigitalIO.h>
    
DigitalOut led1(13,0);

void setup() {
}

void loop() {
    led1 = !led1;
    delay(100);
}
